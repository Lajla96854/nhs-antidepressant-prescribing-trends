# Antidepressant Prescribing Trends in England (2012–2024)
This study examines antidepressant medication prescribing patterns and costs in England's NHS.  
I have merged data from two trustworthy sources: OpenPrescribing (Oxford University) aggregated NHS data (2020–2024) and Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) NHS Digital (2012–2018).  
2019 data are not available due to lack of data on this year on both of the sources.

# Conclusion 
The number of antidepressant items dispensed increased from approximately 50 million in 2012 to approximately 92 million in 2024. Due to the switch between PCA and OpenPrescribing sources According to the results, antidepressant use is rising in England while NHS costs are falling. This trend can undoubtedly be attributed to the use of generic medications and price reductions.
